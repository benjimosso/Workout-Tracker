# Workout-Tracker
# DESCRIPTION
### In this assigment I created a Workout-Tracker Application. 
### This is some of the requirements:
- Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

- Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

- View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

- View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
